ECAPA_SpeakerMatcher -> class ECAPASpeakerMatcher

#load_embeddings_to_memory -> def load_speakers_to_memory

#calculate_adaptive_confidence is perfect
#find_best_match is perfect

Let's rename ECAPA_SpeakerMatcher to FastECAPASpeakerMatcher
What is get_speaker_count used for? It's not used by this code, is it?
What is a tuple? Can we adjust find_best_match to also return uid?
Let's rename reload_embeddings to rebuild_embedding_matrix
In previous iterations the query embedding was provided as torch.Tensor and np.ndarray--which format is more native to how ECAPA TDNN returns an embedding?


    # Extract ECAPA embedding from audio
    ecapa_embedding = extract_ecapa_embedding(audio_buffer)  # Your existing function
    
    # Find best match with adaptive confidence
    speaker_name, uid, confidence = ecapa_matcher.find_best_match(ecapa_embedding)
    
    # Apply your thresholds
    MAYBE_THRESHOLD = 0.70
    DEFINITELY_THRESHOLD = 0.85
    
    if confidence < MAYBE_THRESHOLD:
        print("unknown speaker")
    elif confidence < DEFINITELY_THRESHOLD:
        print(f"{speaker_name}(?)")
    else:
        print(f"{speaker_name}")
